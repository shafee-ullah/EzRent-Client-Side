- Always follow the following design document whenever you are making any change or updating any feature.

Take a whole look at the code structure of frontend and server side. 

I‚Äôm building a full-featured booking and rental platform called EzRent using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Redux Toolkit for state management, with Tailwind CSS for styling.I want to add a new feature/section on my site called ‚ÄúGuest Experiences‚Äù, where only users with the role "guest" can share their travel experiences ‚Äî similar to a Facebook timeline but without comments. Other users (hosts or guests) can only rate each experience on a scale of 1‚Äì10.

Please build the complete implementation for this feature step-by-step with code examples for both backend (Express + MongoDB) and frontend (React + Redux + Tailwind).

üîπ Requirements:

1.Guests can create posts with:

-title

-description

-location

-multiple images (URLs for now)

-user info (name, email, id)

2.Other users can rate the post once (1‚Äì10 scale).

3.Display average rating and total number of ratings on each experience card.

4.Feed should show all posts sorted by newest first.

5.No comments, no edit/delete by others ‚Äî only the guest who created can delete their own post.

6.Use proper REST API endpoints for CRUD operations and rating.

7.No comments or editing by others.

8.Add authentication checks for ‚Äúguest‚Äù role before allowing post creation.

9.Design clean frontend components:
-Add Experience‚Äù form page
-Experiences Feed‚Äù page (grid or card layout)
-Rating button/input (1‚Äì10)
-Display average rating stars or numeric score

10.Use Tailwind CSS for responsive styling.

üîπExpected Deliverables:

MongoDB schema for experiences and ratings

Express routes & controllers (/api/experiences and /api/experiences/:id/rate)

React pages: AddExperience.jsx and ExperienceFeed.jsx

Redux slice for experiences

Example Tailwind-based UI layout for cards and ratings

Step-by-step setup guide

Example Data:

// experience document
{
  _id: "68ebc4a218ad1169707b77a1",
  userId: "68ea9fb418ad1169707b775a",
  userName: "A K M Shafee Ullah",
  title: "My Trip to Cox‚Äôs Bazar",
  description: "Had an amazing beach view!",
  photos: ["https://i.ibb.co/trip1.jpg"],
  location: "Cox‚Äôs Bazar",
  avgRating: 9.2,
  ratingsCount: 10,
  createdAt: "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z"
}

Build the entire workflow end-to-end with best practices, clean code structure, and sample UI for the feed. Use the project theme for styling the components
